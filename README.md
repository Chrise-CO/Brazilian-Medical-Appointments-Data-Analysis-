# Brazilian Medical Appointments Data Analysis 

## by Christabel Onwuka


## Introduction

This is my first project in the Udacity/ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The project, Investigate A Dataset, was focused on analyzing a dataset and then communicating findings about it using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets, performed an investigation and shared my findings through the data analysis process.

## Dataset

The [No-show-appointments](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv) dataset originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) for Udacity's Investigate A Dataset project contains 110,527 records with information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. I focused on finding the trends among patients who show up for their appointments and how they differ from those who do not show up, if there are any trends; including what characteristics make them more likely to show up, if there is a correlation; and, whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Brasilian welfare, [Bolsa Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia) program.



## Summary of Findings

* ***More people showed up for medical appointments*** than did not. On average, most people were more likely to show up for appointments. 

* Of those who showed up, most were females. ***Females were more likely to schedule for appointments than males***.

* The ages of the patients ranged from <1 to 115 with the average age of patients around 37. ***Younger children showed up more than older adults*** for their appointments. 

* Most people who showed up for appointment were ***not enrolled in the welfare Program, [Bolsa Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia)***.

* Of those who showed up for appointments, majority of them were not notified via SMS compared to those who did not show up.

* Health challenges such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism and Handicaps did not seem play any signifacant role in predicting whether a patient showed up or not.



## What I learnt

After completing the project, what I learned include:

- Familiarizing myself with all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Becoming comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Knowing how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a useable format
- Have experience communicating the results of analysis
- Becoming able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
- Becoming familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, for conveniently accessing data
- Knowing how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing findings
